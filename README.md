The video gaming industry is dynamic and ever-evolving, driven by changing consumer preferences and technological advancements. In this project, we analyze historical video game sales data to uncover trends and insights that can inform strategic decisions for developers, publishers, and marketers.

By examining platform performance, genre popularity, regional differences, and the impact of user and critic ratings on sales, we aim to provide valuable insights into market dynamics. Through hypothesis testing, we explore specific hypotheses related to user ratings across different platforms and genres, shedding light on consumer perceptions and purchasing behavior.

Ultimately, this analysis aims to equip stakeholders in the gaming industry with actionable insights to optimize game development strategies and enhance the gaming experience for players worldwide.
